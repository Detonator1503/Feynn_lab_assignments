Fan of tata nexon ev,"I haven't buy this vehicle but I have watched the videos on YouTube and I'll so appreciate this car, It looks are too good and ride quality of the Tata Nexon is already so awesome....",5,5,5,5,5
Awesome best car,"The process was quick and the car is amazing, the design is futuristic and the performance is amazing. the range is good as its 465 km and the infotainment system is mouth watering.",5,5,5,5,5
Tata Nexon EV,"Real power on the same second acceleration given, not able to compare with any other cars. I have used like polo. The way it is designed is also amazing, a much better look both in interior and exterior.",5,5,5,5,3
Crazy car,It is a hatchback car but also it gives me a nice comfort feeling. The brake pedal and accelerator medals are made up of high-quality experience. The instrument cluster gives me a vast detail of my car.,5,5,5,5,5
Range is low,after full night 100 present charge its showing rang 200km in place of 230km and real time rang in sports mode with ac is 120km in 200km how we can expect 230km . we will check eco and normal.,4,3,1,1,1
Just Awesome Machine,"Funky looking compact machine, best for a city commute. Modern Interior With Perimum feel and MG Smart assistant is just the cherry on the cake. Leg room is a bit less but Overall Experience was awesome.",5,5,5,5,5
Excellent city commute EV,Very good car for city commute. Good fit & finish. Practically getting 190 km with ac. Best option for this budget. really fun to drive. No complaints till now. Driven 1400 km till now.,5,5,5,5,5
MG Comet - Design good but Engine Peformance poor - Ride Comfort is very poor,"Buying experience: Booked on the launch date got delivered in June 3rd. Driving Experience: Very very poor - Its purely an auto rickshaw , there is a too much noise coming . They copied the design from Chinese wuling. Batter is from TACO(tata) . Engine is local. Very poor engine. Too much noise while driving. Sales team says that's a feature to fool you around. Ola/TVS Jupiter scooters don't they produce noise while driving . Here MG Comet EV does double noise while driving, Please don't waste money in buying MG Products. Tata EV's are always best.",5,5,1,5,1
Superb car,"Everything is awesome in this car , exterior design could be more better. The interior design is a most attractive thing in this car. I love that. Driving is smooth and battery backup is also decent.",4,5,5,5,5
Value for money,"Purchased the car recently due to long-distance travel on a daily basis.. the car is value for money gives a good range of 200-210 kms..it is an economical mode of driving and has reduced my fuel expenses drastically..good car for two people as there a little less space on the rear seats.. but it is good if two people are commuting in city.. easy to park.. easy to drive .. the engine, pickup everything is satisfactory..",5,3,4,5,4
Not to be sold under car category,This shouldn't be sold in the car segment as it is a share auto. Why anyone would want a car where access and space in the rear seat are totally compromised and does not have boot space at all? It's not a car by any definition.,1,1,1,2,1
A car that is everyone's favorite car,This car is really unique we will suggest people to use this car because there is no bike in comparison to this car and it is a good resource for the middle-class family not only me everyone will like it thank you mg.,5,5,5,5,5
MG Comet EV Plush Review.,Best car in a driving experience and good body and small car which is more useful in cities and in traffics without pollution one of the best manufacturers from MG Motors. It looks like a toy car but is best in experience.,5,5,5,5,4
For middle class Excellence and eye-catching pretty looking car on the road.,"First of all, I haven't purchased a car but one of my friends has this car. And the look is very pretty apart from other cars in this price segment, Driving experience is good not very good. Because I haven't driven an electric car before.",5,5,5,5,5
Best,"Best economy EV for middle-class and daily officers. If your daily route is less than 250km than this car is the best choice for everybody. Also, 4 out of 5 safety rating so we can select this.",5,5,5,5,5
Tata Tiago EV review,"I have purchased the vehicle on 22 Feb. It has already been sent to the service centre twice. The first time, there was an issue with the fasteners of the vehicle. The dashboard was loose and was moving when riding on bumps. There was some weird sound from the left side of the vehicle. It was fixed within a day. After one more week, the vehicle key was not working. The vehicle was not responding to anything. This kind of product is not expected from Tata. I was sceptical about purchasing a Tata car and I regret it now. I wonder how many issues I will get over a few years.",4,3,1,2,1
Best ev in this price bracket,"Good EV is cost-effective and has the best price bracket, tata's safety and reliability are good for family use look is good the seats are comfortable so many features at this price and the best thing is the safety of tata.",4,5,5,5,4
Totally superb car,It's soundless and economical the vehicle always saves your earnings and it gives its cast itself. 3stage speed gives you more adventure and experience. I always recommend you all purchase this.,5,4,4,5,5
Tata Tiago EV review,"The buying experience was not at all satisfying. Took 4 months to get the vehicle delivered and there were no proper updates during the waiting period from the Tata sales executives. The driving experience is far better than manual or automatic cars in this range. The overall looks are okay, can be better. The Interior is good. Servicing and maintenance cost is less when compared to petrol and diesel cars. Pros. 1. Decent range, above 220kms 2. Driving costs less than petrol two-wheelers, 90 paise/km 3. Super silent car 4. Comfortable seats Cons. 1. Top variant is overpriced 2. Range can be 50+ more 3. Slow charging is way too slow. 4. Need 3-phase connection to fix fast charger at home(Tata executive told me this on the delivery date, could have informed earlier so I could have opted for the variant without fast charger and save 50k).",5,5,5,5,4
Outstanding,"I have not felt anything like this before. It is an engineering, Marvel. The price range is a good factor. I will not have to wait for CNG lines anymore. The speaker could be better like my other Tata cars. however, in the end, it is saving a lot of money.",4,5,5,5,5
Revolution Begins,"I am from Kerala, Actually, Kerala is one of the best place to any EVs, to fullfil it's eco friendly missions. Since electricity production in Kerala is mainly from hydroelectric plants, an EV in Kerala is really zero emissions one. I have not purchased Tiago ev, but I am using a brand new Tiago ev of my colleague. It is really a wonderful experience, driving it. The main difference from other electric cars is their size and lower cost of purchase. No sound of any mechanical parts yet after using 8000+ kilometres in our Village roads. Service is also available in our Village. There are few electric cars of tata in our place even though service is much available. Vehicles look and interior are good and modernized.",3,5,5,5,4
Tata Tiago EV review,Looks can be improved. More charging stations need to be introduced. Not suitable for long journeys and for exploring wider areas. The driving experience has been good with good grip and performance is good overall.,4,4,4,4,4
Affordable EV experience,It just took 40 mins during delivery. It feels more punch in Tiago EV than petrol. Easy to drive. Easy to maintain. Most affordable EV experience. Feels a bit overpriced than petrol Tiago in terms of interior quality and elements.,5,3,3,5,4
Loved it,"Highly recommended this Electric suv, loved it. Mahindra is my favorite ever because I have used many vehicles of Mahindra and also recommend others to buy this new xuv 400 ev. I am also going to purchase this within 2 months.",5,5,5,5,5
Mahindra xuv 400 should buy it.,"Now I didn't purchase this car. However, we'll talk about car design. the look is awesome as well as the mileage is also good compared to Nexon. I love this because of the look.",5,5,5,5,5
Very Good,Mahindra recently made a huge announcement about their foray into the electric segment announcing five new eSUVs and their brand new platform allow however a new brand the Xuv.,5,5,5,5,5
Mahindra XUV400 Review,"The range is only 260 don't buy this car not worth the price, choose an alternative car instead of this, no customer service. Mahindra failed in XUV 400 EV completely",5,4,5,1,1
Mahindra XUV400 EL 7.2 kW DT Review,"Defective cars, don't buy them. Break down within 1 month of use. Once the service center is called they give different people's numbers and then there will be various verification calls and the issue will not be resolved",3,3,1,3,1
Mahindra XUV400 EL 7.2 kW Review,"My car was delivered on 16 April 23. Service of the car was Done on 5 May 23.On 11 May 23, in less than a month car broke down. Despite repeated complaints, I am given another number to call.A person came but said to tow the car to workshop. Thereafter next day another person came with a laptop and started the car at the same time I was getting calls from a tow car company also. There was no coordination between various Mahindra team.Approx 25-30 exchange phone calls for one issue it is literally harassment all teams giving different instructions and asking to coordinate with the other. On 13 may 23 someone with a laptop came and said software issue and the car started. The car is always at risk to stop at any time. Now I am being told to call the roadside assistance and get the car towed to the service center as it may stop anytime.There is no certainty of the car working and it is a faulty car. Service response is extremely poor. Please investigate and look into the detail of the issue.",4,3,1,1,1
Fantastic car with this km range,Very good experience to know about this car.. Indian brand car is very good and I prefer to buy this car. Brand our India made cars and buy an electric car to save our environment.,5,5,5,5,5
Best SUV,Driving experience is amazing and its looks are beautiful. I loved that car performance. I think it's best for me. I had a good experience and recommend it to all EV car lovers. It's a good choice.,5,5,5,5,5
Unrealistic Mahindra,"I wasted 4 hours very first day when I went to get a car, some technical problem was there. Now after a few days at 420 km running, again I am stuck at 50 kms away from my place with starting problem. Very unrealistic from Mahindra that's too it's my first car. They sent back car after 3 days, and on every second day the same issue and ev lead of the West zone said I will send a technician tomorrow.",1,1,1,1,1
Mahindra XUV400,"This car is severely overpriced. Tesla Model 3 costs 35000 USD which is 30 lacs. It has a 15-inch screen, a digital cluster, and autonomous driving. When Tesla can make a car in 30 Lacs in the USA where labor cost and parts are so expensive. Mahindra could have easily got it in 20 lacs if they wanted. An old car XUV 300. No R&D is needed, just put in some LEDs and sell the car for a Crazy price.",3,4,4,5,1
Eye catchy,"Best experience I drive this car this is unbeatable at speed , all of this segment cars not beat at of this high speed and the interior are also looking good the tyre size is also good and next driving experience is ultimate seats are also comfortable.",5,5,5,5,5
The Car you need !!,"We took it on a road trip from Nashik to Kolhapur, almost a 800km ride as we covered a few other spots too. I drove it for some 340-350 km and the drive was a real bliss (the rest was driven by my friend himself). Being an EV it made the quietest ride. The car is super economical as 1) its price is sub 50 lakhs compared to the kia ev 6 which costs around 65 lahks and 2) we charged it only twice, which was surprising given that we were 4 adults and had around 50 kg of luggage (yeah I measured it literally). Plus the car looks stunning and sharp and indeed features one of the best aerodynamics in the price segment. Not to mention the tech-loaded cabin it sports! This car is just a complete package and a crazy Value for money.",5,4,5,5,4
Must buy car!!!,"I have driven this car for a trial of about 20 km in the city area. Being an EV it made the quietest ride. The car looks very attractive from the inside and gives you a luxurious feeling. At this price, I am dam sure that no one can give the better option.",5,4,5,4,4
Nice car but with a hefty price !!,"The only thing Hyundai must look for is to reduce the pricing of this car to at least 10-12 lakh per unit. Some features which are not useful for Indians can be eliminated like rear seat warming and other features which can reduce the pricing of the car. The range needs to be revised in the next version, Expectations is to have a 1000km true range with this price range. 50 lakh is again a huge pricing segment for middle-class Indians who are the major contributor to the sales volume of any car segment. 35 lakh should have been the perfect pricing for their car.",5,5,5,5,3
Driving experience,What a car with many different upgraded features that other cars should have. Very smooth running and pure silence after the locking of window glasses. Extra luxurious in seating and stretching the body. I like it so much,5,5,5,4,3
Big Car,"Driving very Smoothly like butter, it's very amazing no words for this car, love her so much, looks very cool feel very rich, and very different look from other, very good performance.",5,5,5,5,5
Dream Car,Overall Good Experience and worth the money. The car has a battery capacity of 76.6kWh with a range of 631 km. Engine power is 216Bhp. It charges in 60min from 0 to 80%. It has 2 variants 1. Normal 2. Automatic.,5,3,5,5,5
If government give some subsidy on the star it is value for money,Overprice but it is good because it give the range of 600 km the car look future stick Hyundai gives new colours on this car it look might be great but I will think the car is over price,5,5,5,5,2
Best EV,I didn't buy but I do test drive this too good car with in plug facility but high price charging was super fast and too good at speed and build quality were too good and if you have money so go for it,5,5,5,5,5
Looks are awesome,Efficiency can be increased in the form of km I just not buy but had a drive from my friend and also visit showroom Driving is quite soft 1st impression is looks If battery works better than all right,5,4,4,4,4
"Great, but there's always room for improvement.","I was able to test ride it for a few KMs, performance is unmatched by anything I've driven before, and features and range are also good. There are some areas where there's room for improvement, There's a space in front of the shifter where you have to keep your phone if you want to use Android Auto/ Apple CarPlay, it's really awkward to access as it's built deep, the infotainment system has a room for a lot of improvement, it's laggy and slow to respond, and just should be better.",5,5,5,5,3
Kia EV6,It's a great design.Kia EV6 is the future car.Kia did a brilliant job in terms of design and comfort.This definitely looks like a perfect sports car.If you're planning for an Kia EV6 this really is the one for you.,5,5,5,5,5
Shocking car,Kia EV6 is absolutely the sexiest looking ever in the all-electric version of the car and also gives the highest mileage ever .its built quality is the strongest ever in this segment that's why kia is fastly growing car company in India.,5,5,5,5,5
Volvo vs kia,it's all about performance and comfort when we choose like premium vehicles the most thing I can get you is can't afford this much price as Volvo starting at 70 lakhs then what's the issue in choosing Urs,4,2,4,4,1
Nice car,"Much more smooth car,it has much power, good boot space,so nice interior design, it has super power,it has highest rating, it charges 80% within 20 minutes totally amazing car....",4,3,2,2,3
Amazing,"It's really nice & the best feeling in driving performance super road capture & audio system, suspension is classified as more than expected nice colour combination & what a pickup of the car.",5,4,5,5,5
Nice car,"Driving experience is very good with valuable prices fast charging and smooth driving experience suspension is very smooth, and the interior is very nice this car and valuable price compared to other company cars.",5,5,5,5,5
Citroen EC3 Value for money,"Citroen needs to work on its application and also needs to have its own charging infrastructure like TATA to compete in this segment. Work on features, and introduce new features.",5,5,5,4,4
Citroen eC3 Live review,Once charging infrastructure gets ready and easily available it will be going to the car. The Buying experience was really amazing. The driving experience was smooth the looks and performance are worth what we paid and its maintenance is I think it's manageable and servicing is good talking about the truth and cons of this car there are a lot of clothes and specific cons the charging issue might be sorted out first.,4,4,4,3,3
Nice E car in small budget with SUV Experience,"Planning to buy an e-car in a small budget. Got a test drive. Super experience, It Felt like driving a toy car with SUV experience. Salespersons, also we're good. Want to buy the same but hesitate only due to one factor the company is new and if winds up in a short time, all money spend will waste. Hope the company do well.",5,5,5,4,4
value for money,"Budget friendly high specification super suspension starting pick up is very super, look vise fantabulous, audio system super sound crystal clear my favorite very nice car in budget friendly car.",5,5,5,5,5
Awesome car,"Driving is very smooth, very best design, safety features good, 260 km mileage time charge, boot space large , better than tiago.",5,4,4,4,4
BYD Atto 3,"I have booked one for myself.I fell in love with this car even before it launched in India.I was following the updates keenly from global launches.The car has got comfort,safety,performance,looks and features.Pure electric born suv with great claimed range of 521 km.I can't wait to get the delivery in January 2023.For those who planning for an EV with a premium category features and comfort.But still don't want to get into Volvo xc40 recharge, Kia ev6 and Hyundai ionic side of the budget.This is the best alternative.I would suggest, the blade battery technology has no match when it comes to safety as well as performance with efficiency too.",5,5,5,5,5
You can buy this car,"This car is amazing and so good experience and value for money and thanks to BYD love it and good job, car quality is superb so safety and fully loaded car thanks to BYD",5,5,5,4,5
Awesome car,"Overall good performance car, feeling like sports car, great comfort, interior and exterior is good. love it ..",4,5,5,4,3
Amazing,"1. Will be buying soon but communicated with the Pune dealer 2. Test drive experience was awesome, my father loved it! 3. Very comfortable and convenient range to cover a maximum range, the smart vehicle will call it. 4. Not experienced servicing and maintenance yet, but seems like it won't be the issue 5. Battery swapping should be integrated accord..",4,4,5,5,5
My experience,"Battery, Electric Motor, and Range: The Atto 3 gets a 60.48 kWh battery pack paired with an electric motor making 204PS and 310Nm. It comes with an ARAI-claimed range of 521 km and gets a front-wheel drivetrain. The electric SUV can sprint from zero to 100 km/h in 7.3 seconds.The car just looks awesome with a muscular and a luxury look. It feels premium inside the car with rotating infotainment and ambient lighting. The comfort and leg space on the back side is enough for a long journey. Charging is convenient and fast. Overall the car is awesome with a good price and customer satisfaction.",5,5,5,4,5
"Futuristic, Safe & Feature Loaded Car","I have driven this car for approx 700 kms. The car has no lag at all, the sports mode of the car gives amazing power to the car, its steering & brakes also change to stiff mode while in Sports Mode. Car has TONS of features, Interiors & infotainment system are next levels. It's a truly futuristic car not just like other EVs available in India Market. BYD has the safest EV battery and car has five star NCAP Rating. Driving experience is pleasant, one may find the car a little expensive but when you drive & experience the feature, it's worth the money spent.",5,5,5,5,5
Just Awesome,"Way to go with this lil giant. Awesome driving experience with comfort. Great mileage and pickup... Smooth and fast along with the stylish icons. I guess ""More Car per Car"" would be the idle slogan for this beast.",4,4,4,5,3
Good But not Great,"Looks like one of the best manufacturers building this car, Have a lot of hope for buying this. People are screwed by make in India concept, Have to agree to disagree !! Will update more thoughts later.",5,5,3,5,5
BYD electric using Blade technology Review WHY and NOT,"Buying Experience Buying experience would be great as BYD is setting up itself in India very supportive and experienced staff they are hiring with good knowledge of EV technology and systems. Showrooms equipped with all basic facilities and high-class ambience. Driving experience As we know Electric cars are power monsters and it holds true for BYD atto 3 as well giving you 300 NM torque which can be feel while driving the car. Should buy for a good driving range, which is currently Hyundai ionic 5 is offering after charging around 48lakhs. Details & looks Unique design and attractive LED setup in cabin and exteriors headlamps and backlight paint quality is good colours are also attractive. Interior is unique and feels like Cruze plane or cockpit-like console. Servicing and Maintenance Still this part is not very clear as they are currently entering in India with some models in terms of maintenance very few service centres are available across India. cons :-- 1. Complete Chinese built and technology 2. Tyres and spare parts Also Chinese car is packed with Chinese tyres ""BATMAN"" ultra gip. 3. Not sure about the service centre and cost of services. 4. Not sure about after-sales support as in electric vehicles there are various minute issues you face on regular basis like charging not working, charger get stuck to the vehicle and unable to detach. 5. Cost is little bit higher side in UP after subsidy in registration charges it is costing around 36,800,00 which is higher in terms of cost to drive prizes should be near around 25-28 lakhs. 6. Dash or super quick charging is missing which Hyundai Ionic is providing (20 min pugging adds up 90% of charging with 230KWH DC charger). Pros: -- 1. Very much comfortable whether it is seating cushioning or leg room space for rear passengers 2. Very spacious and boot size is also good around 500 lit. 3. Car length is about 4580mm which is quite good. 4. Music system quality is superb just like you get in BMW or Mercedes. 5. Driving range is somewhere around 430 to 450 depending upon driving conditions.",5,5,5,4,3
BYD Atto 3 Review,"The dealership experience was good but need more refinement, there are some basics missed by the sales staff required for a customer on charging challenges information for a new EV user. The driving is awesome, performance of the car is really nice, Complete package with value of Money, excellent pickup, road confidence. I have shifted from Skoda to BYD and this EV brand understands the need of customer. Few areas of improvement, Technology support and information guidance is missing. At this point of time India is improving EV infrastructure. The EV charging points and how to charge the vehicle should be informed by dealership with a small demo. I have brought Atto 3 last week only and not experience on service workshop which will be done post 5000 km Finally I can say that the car is a complete satisfaction package for all your needs - Family, Friends, everyone.",5,4,5,5,5
Sub par car with sub par battery,"MG is taking India lightly. No 73kwh battery is given compared to Nepal and price is 3 to 4 lakhs higher and there is no facelifted version. Thank God I cancelled mine, If MG lunches the 73kwh battery version for a few lakhs more it would sell like hot cakes. They are thinking no matter how sub par the product may be Indian buyer will buy it.",3,3,3,1,1
MG ZS EV,I Am Facing Technical Issues With Regard to Software And Hardware Like Ac And Other Switches.They are not Functioning.And MG Service Delaer Including MG Staff Unable to Find Out Fault Since Last 1 Month. So Caar Is With Their Service Dealer And They Are Just Doing Experiment. Good Thing About Car Is that It Is A Sturdy Car With Good Pick Up,3,3,3,4,2
MG ZS EV,This is further to update on my earlier review that car is still with MG service dealer.As per direction of MG technicians they are guessing that there may be issue of electrical wiring and control panel.Hence they are changing these items and opened the car for surgery from head to tail.God knows the items which are fitted at factory by robot or manually how it will work.After being fitted at service centre.I would say it is terrible product so far in my case it is proved.I will further update after few more weeks.I have asked MG India to replace my car so just awaiting for their reply.,3,3,1,3,1
Not Worth to buy MG ZS EV,Exterior and interior design is good but panoramic sunroof is not much require in Indian climate that's wasting of money. One more thing is that eight lacks RS difference between TATA Nexon ev max is not worth Plus servicing issue with some MG buyers so I would like to say you again think about price if you want to compete with NEXON EV MAX. If price difference is about 1.5 to 2.0L then people will think about to purchase MG ZS EV definitely i agree mg battery is plus 10kw as compared to Nexon ev max.,5,5,5,3,1
The best EV you can buy under 25 Lakh,"Having driven over 1000kms the mg zs ev excite is a fantastic car. The range is over 350km on highway. In cities, the range is between 260-320km. The suspension is on the softer side. Ground clearance is good. The performance is stellar for a sub 25L car. MG service so far has been outstanding. The cons so far are the 360 cameras are of poor quality, no auto dimming irvm or electrically folded orvm in the base model. No ventilated seats or rear arm rest. The car is amazing to drive. Highly recommended.",5,5,5,5,5
MG ZS EV review,"While sub 30L EVs choices are still quite limited now, my major choice between MG ZS and Nexon EV was, like most other buyers, range anxiety. Nexon looks decent, almost 8L cheaper lost because talking to some owners gave me worries about being less 250KM on full charge. 250 is a distance that's not bad for city drivers. But given how EV Charging infrastructure is in India right now seemed risky. Some users do claim 300 Range on EV MAX but when I checked in their App stats that seemed like far fetched claim. Glad to have chosen MG ZS though the cost was quite higher. ARAI claim was 461KM but after crossing 2000 KM on my MG including a 1000KM long drive I can pretty much have a honest stat to provide. City driving: You will easily get 320-350 depending on your driving habit. Highway driving: if you drive well, utilizing cruise controls, non-aggressive accelerations, KERS braking you can easily get 380-400. Having sunroof a little open or AC on internal circulation, you can conserve range well. But you will definitely sacrifice somewhat 20-30KM. Performance: Well, ECO mode is what you mostly need, Normal has a lot of power. Sports mode, save it for afterlife. the car never feels lacking power even in Eco mode. In fact, Steep office parking ramps are easily overpowered in ECO mode itself. I have done 150 Km/h in eco mode easily. Haven't tried that in SPORTS. Hill driving is smooth. There is hill decent assist as well. Auto brakes assist not rolling backwards. Superb easy to drive. Looks: Car looks great from front (Minus the front grill that they have reworked out of Astor, made of flimsy plastic. you can bend it with single finger press ). I really hope MG redoes the front grill for ZS EV. The back is really ordinary. Nothing of it looks like a 28L+ car. No Fog lamps (WTF MG), Headlights are decent (Expected more lumens). Panoramic Sun roof is great. Interior is pretty good, premium and organized. Features: No complains. Although 360 camera is pretty bad quality, not very useful other than kind of guessing what's being shown, you cannot guess how far things are on the sides. Images are very very distorted. But getting to see your wheels help. Comfort: Expected better stabilized soft suspensions. The car has higher ground clearance, therefore every pothole shakes your whole body like some weird dance move. Seats are comfortable premium leather. But not ventilated. Long trips make you sweat a lot. Overall verdict: A great car but at a premium price. To compete with all the upcoming EVs MG needs to bring it down to a rational level. Else very few will buy it once Govt. stops zero road tax scheme on EVs. Cause the car will easily cross 32L mark there.",5,5,5,5,4
Best Ev out there,I am a very satisfied customer of MG ZS The car provides me with a range of over 350 km the car is there a responsible and very quick when it comes to acceleration The car has cut down my travelling costs to a minimum because the cost of running this car is from 50 Paisa to 80 Paisa per kilometre Very highly recommended to people who travel a lot on a daily basis. The features and the service offered by Mg is very delightful and useful,5,5,5,5,4
Worst Road Side Assistance,Worst roadside assistance service. Standing on the road because of the fault in the system and raised roadside assistance request at 11:00 AM and no service is provided until 09:00 PM. We were standing on the road the whole day.,5,3,4,3,3
Warranty is fake. Nothing gets repaired without insurance claim,A very poor car. The car does not even show the range (km) the company claims even after full charge. Servicing is always pathetic. Keep receiving calls from service people to give best ratings even when they have done shoddy work. Sensors of car go haywire and service company looks the other way and does nothing. So much for the warranty as they just want to dupe customer and force customer to go for insurance claim in spite of their job to rectify the issues.,2,2,1,1,1
MG ZS EV review,Buying experience was a bit tedious as we had to purchase for our company. The time taken was a little longer. Other than all good about the car. The wheel caps are of cheap quality.,4,5,5,4,4
Be a change harbinger : Embrace the future,"I test-drove the MG EV Exclusive. The experience was awesome. Good looks, spacious, great pickup (it flies on Sports Mode), very efficient in cost/km and run/charge and eco-friendly.",4,5,5,5,4
MG ZS EV 2021 - Currant Red Exclusive (My EV beast),"MG ZS EV Red Current Exclusive model - 2 months (~2700Kms), This car exterior looks are stunning and gives a proper SUV look. Just fell in love with it. Performance and range is just amazing. range: 300-350. I have already driven a long trip of 3 days of about 1100 kms without having hassle of charging issues. A little bit of planning required and you will enjoy your journey. It really feels like a flight taking off when we switch to sport mode and accelerate from 0 to 100, which generates massive torque of 350 nm and a rubber band effect while cruising in. Charging infra in Bengaluru is too good and its growing rapidly, but govt. and charging infra companies need to understand that more than in Cities the charging stations are required in Highways. In Cities mostly we use home charging which is way too much to daily commute. Overall its a pleasure and pride to own an EV. Doesn't matter whether its MG or TATA or Mercedes or Hyundai. Yes the EV car prices are expensive, but very soon its going to reduce as battery technology improves. I also see there is lot of lack of knowledge and myths about EV's in people which I will try to cover in my very first blog soon. I will try to address below questions about EV. 1) Why EV? 2) Can I go for long drives in EV? 3) Resale value of EVs? 4) Are EVs really environment friendly? 5) Charging apps and Home Charging facilities 6) Battery technology trends 7) MG ZS EV (I Own) 8) Ather 450X (I Own) 9) Other EVs 10) Regenerative Breaking",5,5,5,5,5

Genuine review,Best electric car in Indian market. Imported from Netherlands and assembled in Gujarat. Having a battery pack of 44.5 kwh range of 300-400 km. Will get a minimum range of 300km with ac and 370km without ac ( Nexon is having 30kwh battery 180-250 km range will get a minimum range of 180km with ac and 250 without ac).,5,5,5,5,5
MG ZS E V,Best car in segment. Go for it. I like it. The best comfortable car. It has a very good engine and does not sound like a single burr. It is my best car I think in this segment. Go for it. Go for it please.,5,5,5,5,5
VALUE FOR MONEY - GO FOR IT!!!!!,"The car performs as expected. One charge range is around 260-270 kms on highways at 100 km/h with air-conditioning turned on. The range increases to 300-310 kms if speed is reduced to 80 km/h on highways with air-conditioning turned on. In city conditions, if driven on a light foot at a speed up to a max of 65 km/h, the range increases to 345-355 kms with air-conditioning turned on. The range increases by about 15% for full charge if air-conditioning is turned off. I have done 2 trips to Chennai and back from my home town (erode) which is around 420-430 kms away, With one stop of 30-40 minutes for charging in a 50kw charger during which I have my breakfast in the hotel right next to it. The total cost worked out to around Rs.1.5/ per km when you when you average the charging cost done at home with the charge done at the highway using the 50kw charger. The cost reduces further to Rs. 0.70 - 0.80 paise if charged only at home during everyday use. It makes sense to buy an EV only if you do a minimum of 1700-2000 kms per month. If your monthly running is any lesser, It would make more sense to buy a petrol car and use the extra money that would have been used to buy the EV on fuel. A lot of charging stations are coming up on highways which would make it easier to travel in an EV. The only catch is you have to plan an extra hour in your travel time for charging which I personally feel is ok, when you consider the money saved on fuel. I personally would have shelled out Rs.7500/- on a round trip of 1000 kms using my ICE car. I paid a total of Rs.1500-1600/- on the same round trip combining the charging cost at home with the charge done at the public charging station.",4,4,5,5,4
Terrible customer service,"The sales experience for this car was pretty smooth. The car is a decent car, but it seems I have received a defective piece. The worst part is the customer service, this is easily the worst customer service I have received from any company in my life, I literally have to run behind them to even get them on call. I would advise you to steer clear of all MG products.",3,4,1,1,3
MG EV Icon,"I love this car because it's give a lot of power, mileage and features. I think this car is going to be the icon of all ev cars. It's price is affordable. This is a fully loaded package ev car. It gives great power, features, safety and value for money package car.",5,5,5,5,5
Nice drive but mileage drops on highway,"Mileage drops by 20% with AC on, and a further 20% on a highway. Max range of 320 drops to only about 240 on a highway with AC. Not suitable for long drives, and only city driving, for which it is too expensive.",4,3,3,2,2
Awesome,"Now a days petrol prices are raising day by day, so we want to implement for electric car Save pollution in city and smooth drive for the feature life, Nice investment for the feature. Don't miss the awesome car book again as soon as possible Don't miss the chance, Have a nice day",5,5,5,5,5
Torque beast,"Being an existing Volvo owner of the V40 and S60 CC, i was very excited about the XC40 recharge. Received an invitation from Martial motors Bangalore on launch day and they were kind enough to arrange a test drive. Driving experience:- The Ev like most of them are dead silent, the power and torque is probably the best I've experienced so far in my life. 408 BHP and around 600 NM of torque will surely cause some people to get a headache from the head going back onto the comfortable orthopedic seats. It zoom passed 140 in Bangalore traffic roads in under 8 secs... 0-100 in around 5 secs. The car is a tad smaller compared to the rivals... But 60 lacks is probably worth paying considering you get a solid rock hard kind of a tank with insane speeds and acceleration and humble and affordable Volvo service. Over all a great car and a wonderful experience.",5,3,5,5,4

My Volvo car review after driving 1000 kms,"Volvo starts its journey in India with the XC40 Recharge, its first-ever fully electric car and also, the first model to appear in its brand-new Recharge car line concept. While the Swede seeks to make all-electric cars 50 per cent of its global sales by 2025, the other half will consist of mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrids. For 2022, the company reworks the Volvo XC40 with fresher styling cues, more features on the inside, and a mild-hybrid petrol motor. I really enjoyed a lot driving with this. This car feels comfortable in the village area also. And one thing to tell you it gives me around 350 to 380 range tried in mixed condition. Overall a great car if you look for comfort & safety.",4,4,5,4,4
Best electric car ever,One of best electric car in India safety wise range wise & looks all over very good car I ever seen... I'll definitely want to buy this car in few months... Volvo is the safest brand,5,5,5,4,4
Hyundai Kona review,"Pretty good car, smooth as a glider fast car, instant pickup and the range in one charge is also pretty good as well, so we can go more miles, a catchy car grab our eye balls everyone wants to ride this",5,5,5,5,5
Hyundai is just everything... Fullypacked,"Amazing,Amazing Fully electric car with amazing power delivery and Battery efficiency with amazing warrenty. Hyundai did great job. Surely Hyundai is the Future for Automotive One thing in India the govt must reduce the tax of this car.. by govt tax its around 30lakh in my city.. but with out tax its about 25lakh... Indian Govt please reduce the tax..",5,4,5,5,5
Awesome car,Wow its an awesome car. And a great car for all people. But they are not launched by manual gear. This are the mistakes. If they launched the manual gear its very great. Please fix an manual gear as soon as posible. While iam seeing the Hyundai car all are awesome. So all of u just trust the Hyundai and buy the car.,5,5,5,5,5

Excellent,Good experience good driving experience all performance good very low maintenance good buying experience and driving experience and good looking wise and good performance etc. Low maintenance,5,5,5,5,5
The new premium,"Except for the short legroom in the rear, this is a performance car. I wish they are completely removed the boot as electrics will be only a second or third car in most families. This would have given far more leg room for rear passengers. Brilliant car otherwise.",5,3,5,5,4
Concern of price and charging facilities.,Price difference between petrol and electronic could not convince customer to buy electronic car. Difference amount can use for Life time use of petrol diesel car. Moreover long ride is big concern for charging. Only useful for fix route of almost 100 km. Price should be reduced and charging pump should be developed more.,4,4,5,3,2
